# 💼 Employee Payroll System in Java (Terminal-Based)

Welcome to the **Employee Payroll System** – a terminal-based Java project designed to demonstrate core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in action.

This project offers a hands-on way to understand how to structure and implement a real-world payroll system using abstract classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
